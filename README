Hi there, you are probably here from the badcode subreddit. I genuinely had no idea how to tackle this problem so i thought an idea of 'cycling' variables in and 
out would be the best way to deal with this. here are the instructions if you want to try it.



We have 8 numbers 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8
Each number has a specific type that can be associated with it

1-1 = perfect unison
1-4 = perfect fourth
1-5 = perfect fifth
And 1-8 are perfect intervals 1-8 = perfect octave
1 and 8 are the same 1 is low octave (lower pitched), 8 is high octave (higher pitched)

1-2 = major 2nd
1-3 = major 3rd
1-6 = major 6th
1-7 = major 7th
Are major intervals


When you LOWER a major interval by one semitone it becomes a minor interval
(when we lower by one semi tone we put this symbol “b”

When you LOWER a perfect interval by one semitone it becomes a diminished interval.
When you LOWER a minor interval  by one semitone it becomes a diminished interval.
When lowering a minor interval one semitone to diminished we put two “bb”

When you RAISE a major interval by one semitone it becomes an augmented interval.
When you RAISE a perfect interval by one semitone it becomes an augmented interval.
When raising major and perfect intervals a semitone we put this symbol “#”

P = perfect interval
M = major interval
m = minor interval
D = diminished interval
U = unison

So we have many possibilities of said 8 notes

1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8    =    PU, M2, M3, P4, P5, M6, M7, P8
1-2-b3-#4-5-6-b7-8    =    PU, M2, m3, A4, P5, M6, m7, P8

Most patterns are either 5 numbers long, up to 8 numbers long and sometimes when they have less numbers have patterns of numbers.

1-2-3-5-6-8 (pentatonic scale aka 5 number length)
1-3-4-5-7-8 (also pentatonic scale but different pattern)

1-2-b3-5-b6-8
1-b3-4-5-b7-8 - same pattern as before but now different formula

We have 5 note scales - pentatonic
6 note scales - hexatonic
7 note scales - heptatonic (diatonic)
8 note scales - octatonic

These scales don't always have to be numerical in order 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8
They can have doublings of the same number like so
1-b3-3-4-b5-5-8
All scales will start on 1 and end on 8



Your goal is to print out every possible combination and have a counter that lets you know how many combinations there are.
